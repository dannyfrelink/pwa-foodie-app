## üí° Concept

For this project, I was meant to recreate my previously made website into a server-side variant. Therefore, you can find all the explanation of the concept in the Readme of my other repo [Foodie-app](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/foodie-app#the-foodie-app).

This time, I was able to work with server side routing, so there were lots of thing to refactor. I tried to keep the layout of my application as much the same as possible. I also created an offline page with Service Workers to display if you're browsing my website offline.

## üìù Wishlist

Since, there was a really short period to work on this project, there are a couple things I would've liked to add. First, my idea was to save the searched products in the cache of the browser. When searching offline, I wanted to give the user the opportunity to browse through the cached products. Sadly, there was little time to complete this. Secondly, I wanted to create a propper empty state with a save function for products. This also would have taken to much time, so sadly I wasn't able to complete this.
