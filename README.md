## üí° Concept

For this project, I was meant to recreate my previously made website into a server-side variant. Therefore, you can find all the explanation of the concept in the Readme of my other repo [Foodie-app](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/foodie-app#the-foodie-app).

This time, I was able to work with server side routing, so there were lots of thing to refactor. I tried to keep the layout of my application as much the same as possible. I also created an offline page with Service Workers to display if you're browsing my website offline.

## Service-worker

To cache my files into the browser, I implemented a service-worker to my project. In this service-worker I decided to cache an offline page, my CSS en Client-side JS. Therefore, when the network is down, the user is redirected to the offline page.

I also decided to cache some HTML pages when the user has searched them. I cached the home page and the product pages they searched. My idea was to display the earlier searched products on the offline page. As descriped on the wishlist, there was to little time left to make this happen. To make the website work faster, I decided to display the cached pages at first. If the page is not cached already, I add this page to the cache as well.

## Critical-Render-Path

For my optimalisation I started off with adding compression. I installed the npm package 'compression'. Then I added a caching header to my server side JS as well. Both of them are implementen with an `app.use`.

I also added responsive images to my project by using `srcset`. You can find my code down below:
```html
<img 
    src=<%=product.image_url %>
    srcset="
        <%= product.image_url %> 400w, 
        <%= product.image_small_url %> 200w, 
        <%= product.image_thumb_url %> 100w
    "
    alt="Product image"
>
```
I also tested my website thoroughly with Lighthouse and decided to improve my performance. I did this by adding some widths and heights to my elements.

## üìù Wishlist

Since, there was a really short period to work on this project, there are a couple things I would've liked to add. First, my idea was to save the searched products in the cache of the browser. When searching offline, I wanted to give the user the opportunity to browse through the cached products. Sadly, there was little time to complete this. Secondly, I wanted to create a propper empty state with a save function for products. This also would have taken to much time, so sadly I wasn't able to complete this.

## üîß Installation

If you want to use my code for your own, you can clone the repository as a local file:

```
    git clone https://github.com/dannyfrelink/pwa-foodie-app
```

You then need to install all NPM packages:

```
    npm install
```

After this, you can start building the files:

```
    npm run build
```

To start the project and watch any changes in the files, you can use these lines:

```
    npm start
    npm run watch
```
